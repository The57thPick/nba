# OpenNBAVoting: *An on-going analysis of NBA regular-season awards*

## ℹ️ Introduction

The voting process for the NBA's most prestigious awards&mdash;such as *MVP*,
*DPOY*, and its *All-NBA Teams*&mdash;has always been fairly ill-defined
in terms of both *who* votes and *how* they voted. The rules have
[changed drastically][1] over the years and the full voting results weren't
even published until the 2015 season.

Since that 2015 season, the NBA has released the results as [PDF-formatted][3]
documents tabulated by Ernst &amp; Young LLP. And while this was certainly
a major step forward in transparency, the format isn't very useful for data
analysis.

We're working to change that.

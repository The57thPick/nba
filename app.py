        In 2016, the NBA players and Board of Governors ratified a new
        [Collective Bargaining Agreement][2]. This agreement included a
        "designated player" exception that allows a team to sign one of its own
        players to a five-year maximum contract extension, according to the
        [following criteria][4]:


        > 1. He makes one of the three all-NBA teams or is named either
             defensive player of the year or most valuable player the previous
             season.
        > 2. He has made one of the three all-NBA teams or has been named
            defensive player of the year in two of the prior three seasons or
            the league‚Äôs most valuable player in one of the three prior
            seasons.

        This is exception comes in addition to the well-known
        "[Derrick Rose Rule][3]," which incentivizes making All-NBA teams
        during a player's first four years. In response to the heightened
        stakes of its media-based awards, the NBA also made a [few changes][1]
        to its voter-selection process in 2016:

        > 1. Decreased the number of eligible voters for each award from 130 to 100.
        > 2. Limited the selection pool to "independent" media members (no
           radio/television broadcasters or writers associated with a
           particular team).
        > 3. Required at least one voter per NBA market.

        In total, the NBA's media-based awards have more meaning than ever and
        understanding the process has become all the more important.

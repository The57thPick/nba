        In 2016, the NBA players and Board of Governors ratified a new
        [Collective Bargaining Agreement][2]. This agreement included a
        "designated player" exception that allows a team to sign one of its own
        players to a five-year maximum contract extension, according to the
        [following criteria][4]:


        > 1. He makes one of the three all-NBA teams or is named either
             defensive player of the year or most valuable player the previous
             season.
        > 2. He has made one of the three all-NBA teams or has been named
            defensive player of the year in two of the prior three seasons or
            the league‚Äôs most valuable player in one of the three prior
            seasons.

        This is exception comes in addition to the well-known
        "[Derrick Rose Rule][3]," which incentivizes making All-NBA teams
        during a player's first four years. In response to the heightened
        stakes of its media-based awards, the NBA also made a [few changes][1]
        to its voter-selection process:

        > 1. Decreased the number of eligible voters for each award from 130 to 100.
        > 2. Limited the selection pool to "independent" media members (no
           radio/television broadcasters or writers associated with a
           particular team).
        > 3. Required at least one voter per NBA market.

        In total, the NBA's media-based awards have more meaning than ever and
        understanding the process has become all the more important.

        The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a means of assessing
        the *quality* of a given ballot. A common complaint with the
        existing process is that voters are somehow "biased" or are actively
        supporting a certain "agenda." Unfortunately, although it's
        straightforward to describe the perceived problem, it's much harder to
        actually identify it in practice.

        For example, one of the most high-profile cases in recent times was
        [Gary Washburn's decision][2] to select Carmelo Anthony over LeBron
        James as the 2013 MVP, effectively robbing him of the chance to become
        the NBA's first *unanimous* choice (a feat Stephen Curry would later
        accomplish in 2016).

        > "I was heated," James told Chris Haynes, then of Cleveland.com.
        > "But I knew all along [I wasn't getting a unanimous vote]. I just
        > knew it, man."
        >
        > -- [A brief history of LeBron James disagreeing with awards voters][3]

        While you might be tempted to say that identifying *unusual*
        ballots (such as Washburn's) is a good indication of poor choices, it's
        really not that simple&mdash;indeed, what if it's the consensus
        *itself* that's "wrong"?

        This was exactly the case in 2021, [according to Jayson Tatum][1]:

        > ‚ÄúI know I should have made it with the season I had,‚Äù Tatum told host
        > Ashley Nevel. ‚ÄúI mean $33 million on the line. Obviously, that would
        > make anyone feel some type of way. And I wasn‚Äôt necessarily upset
        > about losing the money. I think I just felt like the way I was
        > playing, everything I did, I thought it should have been a
        > no-brainer. I think I was just more frustrated with that.‚Äù

        However, even if it may not be possible to derive objective conclusions
        from an inherently subjective process, we can still perform some
        interesting data analysis.
